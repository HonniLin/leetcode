#
# Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height
# where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in
# the histogram.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
# The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10
# units.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: heights = [2,4]
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4
# 
#

class Solution:
    # The stack maintain the indexes of buildings with ascending height. Before adding a new building pop the building who is taller than the new one. 
    # The building popped out represent the height of a rectangle with the new building as the right boundary and the current stack top as the left boundary. 
    # Calculate its area and update ans of maximum area. Boundary is handled using dummy buildings.
