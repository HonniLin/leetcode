#
# You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k
# which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can
# only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves
# right by one position.
# 
# Return the max sliding window.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
# Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
# Explanation: 
# Window position                Max
# ---------------               -----
# [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
# ⁠1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
# ⁠1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
# ⁠1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
# ⁠1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
# ⁠1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# 1 <= k <= nums.length
# 
#

class Solution:
    # Keep indexes of good candidates in deque d. 
    # The indexes in d are from the current window, they're increasing, and their corresponding nums are decreasing. 
    # Then the first deque element is the index of the largest window value.
    # For each index i:
    # Pop (from the end) indexes of smaller elements (they'll be useless).
    # Append the current index.
    # Pop (from the front) the index i - k, if it's still in the deque (it falls out of the window).
    # If our window has reached size k, append the current window maximum to the output.
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        output = []
        q = collections.deque() # index
        l = r = 0
        while r < len(nums):
            while q and nums[q[-1]] < nums[r]:
                q.pop()
            q.append(r)
            if l > q[0]:
                q.popleft()
            if (r + 1) >= k:
                output.append(nums[q[0]])
                l += 1
            r += 1
        return output
