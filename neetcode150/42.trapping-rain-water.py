#
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array
# [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section)
# are being trapped.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
# 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
#

class Solution:
    # Search from left to right and maintain a max height of left and right separately, which is like a one-side wall of partial container. 
    # Fix the higher one and flow water from the lower part. 
    # For example, if current height of left is lower, we fill water in the left bin. Until left meets right, we filled the whole container.
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        leftMax, rightMax = height[l], height[r]
        res = 0
        while l < r:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
                res += leftMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                res += rightMax - height[r]
        return res
