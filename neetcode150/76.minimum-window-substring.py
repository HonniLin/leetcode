# Testcase Example:  '"ADOBECODEBANC"\n"ABC"'
#
# Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum
# window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates)
# is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty
# string "".
# 
# The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
# 
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C'
# from string t.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "a", t = "a"
# Output: "a"
# Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
# Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == s.length
# n == t.length
# 1 <= m, nÂ <= 10^5
# s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
#

class Solution:
    # The current window is s[i:j] and the result window is s[start: end].
    # In need[c] I store how many times I need character c (can be negative) and missing tells how many characters are still missing.
    # In the loop, first add the new character to the window.
    # Then, if nothing is missing, remove as much as possible from the window start and then update the result.
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < len(t):
            return ""
        need = collections.Counter(t)
        missing = len(t)
        start, end = 0, 0
        i = 0
        for j, char in enumerate(s, 1):
            if need[char] > 0:
                missing -= 1
            need[char] -= 1
            if missing == 0:
                while i < j and need[s[i]] < 0:
                    need[s[i]] += 1
                    i += 1
                need[s[i]] += 1
                missing += 1
                if end == 0 or j - i < end - start:
                    start, end = i, j
                i += 1
        return s[start: end]
